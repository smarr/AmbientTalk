# AmbientTalk

The official AmbientTalk repositories are at https://gitlab.soft.vub.ac.be/groups/ambienttalk.

This repository is merely for my own convenience and includes the most relevant
sub-repositories for some explorative work.

When cloning this repository, make sure all submodules are cloned as well:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/smarr/AmbientTalk.git
